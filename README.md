1) Raft is a distributed consensus algorithm where multiple nodes have to agree with each other.

2) Each node is a:
    - Follower
    - Candidate
    - Leader

3) In the beginning every node is a follower and there is no leader.
    Then there is an election where one leader is elected (150ms to 300ms)
    There is an election timer that expires, and a follower becomes a candidate, votes for itself and asks for a vote
    from every other node. Then each node, if they havent voted in the election cycle, vote again. The node then resets the timer.

4) Once the leader is elected, they send AppendEntries messages to its followers.

5) Once a leader is elected, all changes go through the leader. Changes are added as an entry to the log of the leader however until a majority is reached, they are not implemented. Once there is consensus, the leader notifies that the entry has been committed. Entry is committed and node state is updated.

6) The AppendEntries are sent as heartbeats

7) Election term continues until followers stop recieving heartbeats and becomes a candidate

8) There is a case for a split vote (lets say there are 2 clients and 5 nodes). There will be 3 that recieve a majority and the network barrier is broken. 

9) For log replication, after the leader recieved a majority from the replies of the AppendEntries, it commits the changes


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leader Election
 
- 2 timeout settings
    election timeout is the time a follower waits before becoming a candidate (rand b/w 150ms and 300ms)
    Node votes for itself and asks for votes (Request Vote)
    if requested node hasnt voted in this term, it votes again and node resets the election timeout

    Leader is elected from the majority and sends an AppendEntries message to its followers. These messages are sent as heartbeats

    Followers respond to each respondEntries message. Election term till followers stops recieveing heartbeats. Then stoo leader and re-election

- In case of split vote, two nodes send messages at the same time. Each candidate has 2 votes and no more for this term. Nodes wait for a new election

Leader election
The leader periodically sends a heartbeat to its followers to maintain authority. A leader election is triggered when a follower times out after waiting for a heartbeat from the leader. This follower transitions to the candidate state and increments its term number. After voting for itself, it issues RequestVotes RPC in parallel to others in the cluster. Three outcomes are possible:

The candidate receives votes from the majority of the servers and becomes the leader. It then sends a heartbeat message to others in the cluster to establish authority.
If other candidates receive AppendEntries RPC, they check for the term number. If the term number is greater than their own, they accept the server as the leader and return to follower state. If the term number is smaller, they reject the RPC and still remain a candidate.
The candidate neither loses nor wins. If more than one server becomes a candidate at the same time, the vote can be split with no clear majority. In this case a new election begins after one of the candidates times out.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Log Replication

- Request sent by leader for AppendEntries. Client sends the change to the leader, which commits after a majority is recieved, response sent to the client
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


State variables:
--------------------------------------
ALL servers 
currentTerm - index of the lastest term the server has seen
votedFor    - candidate id that recieved vote in current term
log[]       - log entries

volatile across servers
commitIndex - last incdex comitted
lastApplied - index of the lastest log applied to the state machine

volatile across leaders
nextIndex[]  - for each server, index of the log entry to be send to that server
matchIndex[] - for each server, index of highest log entry replicated on the server
--------------------------------------
AppendEntries RPC
term, leaderID, prevLogIndex, prevLogTerm, entries[] - empty for appendRPC, send more for efficieny, leaderCommit

- term < currentTerm return false
- return false if there is no prevLogterm for the latest prevLogIndex
- if entry conflicts (same entry different terms), delete it and all that follow
- append new entries not in the log
- if leaderCommit > commitIndex, min (leaderCommit, index of latest commit)

--------------------------------------
RequestVote RPC
term, candidateID, LastLogIndex, LastLogTerm

- if term < currentTerm return false
- if votedFor is null or candidateId and candidate's log is at least as up to date as the recievers log, grant vote
--------------------------------------
Rules for all servers
- if commitIndex > lastApplied, lastApplied = commitIndex
- if rpc contains term T > currentTerm, currentTerm = T, convert to follower

Rules for followers
- respond to candidates and leaders
- if no heartbeat comes for leader or granting vote to new candidate, start new election and become candidate

Rules for candidate
start an election and
- increment cuurentTerm
- vote for self
- send RequestVote rpc
- reset election timer

if majority votes recieved become leader
if appendEntries rpc become follower
if no response, new timer

leaders
- upon election send empty appendEntries Rpcs
- if command recievd from client, append entry to log after entry applied to state machine
- if logIndex >= nextIndex send AppendEntries Rpc with log entries starting at nextIndex 
    if successful update nextIndex and logEntries, else decrement nextIndex and try again
- N > commitIndex, a majority
of matchIndex[i] â‰¥ N, and log[N].term == currentTerm: set commitIndex = N
